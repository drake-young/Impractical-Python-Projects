# Impractical Python Projects Implementations

Out of boredom, I bought myself the book "Impractical Python Projects: Playful Programming Activities to Make You Smarter". I figured I would share my implementations of the various projects in the book as I work through them. Each project is implemented as a self-contained jupyter notebook with appropriate documentation. 

Please consider supporting the author, Lee Vaughan, and give the book a read
